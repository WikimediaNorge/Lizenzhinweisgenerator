<p>This tool makes it easy to reuse images from Wikipedia and the free media archive <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikimedia
    Commons</a>.</p>
<p>Please note: The current English version of the Attribution Generator is based on a near-verbatim
    translation of the initial German text snippets, which were drafted with the copyright law of
    Germany in mind. Especially the parts explaining legal concepts might thus differ from the
    copyright law situation of other countries.</p>
<p>In many cases images on Wikipedia and the free media archive Wikimedia Commons are protected by
    copyright. However most of them have been released under free licenses by their rights holders,
    especially under Creative Commons licenses. Some are even free of any rights, in the public
    domain. Free licenses facilitate an easy re-use as long as the respective license requirements
    are honoured. An additional permission from rights holders is then not necessary. This tool is
    designed to help comply with the license conditions and simplify the use of freely licensed
    content. The tool automatically compiles all relevant license information in to a
    so-called license notice that has to be published or displayed as closely to the image as
    reasonably possible (depending on the publication type the license notice can also be placed at
    another common position e.g. within picture credits in a book or in the opening or final credits of a
    video). The tool leads you through a short dialogue and compiles all the information that is
    relevant for generating a correct license notice for your individual use case. After having
    answered these few questions you can quickly and easily copy the license notice in various
    formats and paste it into your publication. Currently, the tool covers the re-use in digital and
    printed works, being the most frequent forms of use. Other uses (e.g. exhibitions, broadcasts,
    live performances) remain unconsidered for the time being.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Dr. Till Jaeger, specialist lawyer for copyright and media law (JBB
    Rechtsanw√§lte in Berlin) for his generous support.</p>

    However, it can never cover all use cases and characteristics, and thus cannot replace qualified
    legal advice by a lawyer.
